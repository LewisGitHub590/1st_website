            <h1>The Story Of Lucia Ramirez</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="aboutustext">
            “Lucia Ramirez was a local banker who had a fondness for cooking since he was 15 years of age. He had a Sicilian father and an Italian mother with Greek ancestry, who moved to England when he was 17 years of age.
            <br>
            <br>
            After the move, he assisted his mother and father in their love for cooking and gardening growing his talent in creating some of the finest recipes with the freshest recipes sourced ingredients available.
            <br>
            <br>
            When Lucia was 22 years old, he became a banker for Halifax where he stayed with them for 35 years. He later became the manager of the local Cheshire branch, where he was adored by many for his constant conversations about his garden, especially his strawberry bushes and conifers.
            <br>
            <br>
            At the age of 57, his father tragically died prematurely of a heart attack, which made him Lucia to reimagine his future and so later that same year began to open up a business that became ‘The Coffee Shop’.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although it took three years in the making, when ‘The Coffee Shop’ opened on the 19th of February 2015, it was an instant success. Due to the popularity of Lucia in the local community, the shop went from strength to strength and is now one of the most prestigious coffee stores in the whole of Cheshire.”
