            <p>Origin Of the Coffee Shop:
                “Since its establishment in 2015, by local Chesire-based Lucia Ramirez, ‘The Coffee Shop’ has been an independent coffee retailer that has helped raise money within the community by working with local causes.
                As of 2018, they have raised over £5000 for public causes, such as Cancer Research, The Red Cross and Save The Woodland Close.
                This has made ‘The Coffee Shop’ a pinnacle stronghold in the community, and we are proud to have them and what they have done for the residents and the locals.</p>
